selfish spammer

this is a prototype for nrf5x devices that mimic the gapple contact tracing
protocol, but instead of valid beacons sends out beacons where the rpi/aem is
random garbage, however it also logs any valid gapple beacons so that a user
can still use this data to check if there was a contact with an diagnosed
person.
